Wofa Language
Wofa is a simple, interpreted programming language designed for educational purposes. It includes basic constructs such as variables, assignments, print statements, for loops, and if statements. This README provides an overview of how to use Wofa and contribute to its development.

Features
Variable Declaration: Declare variables using var.
Print Statements: Output values to the console with print.
For Loops: Loop through a range of values.
If Statements: Conditional execution based on expressions.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Dart SDK: Ensure you have Dart SDK installed on your system. You can download it from Dart's official website.
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wofa.git
Navigate into the project directory:

sh
Copy code
cd wofa
Get dependencies:

sh
Copy code
dart pub get
Usage
To run a Wofa script:

Create a Wofa script: Save your Wofa code in a .wofa file, for example, example.wofa.

Example Wofa script (example.wofa):

wofa
Copy code
wofa var x = 5; wofa
wofa print x; wofa
wofa for (var i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) { wofa
wofa print i; wofa
wofa } wofa
wofa if (x > 10) { wofa
wofa print "x is greater than 10"; wofa
wofa } wofa
wofa x = x * 2; wofa
wofa print x; wofa
Run the Wofa interpreter:

sh
Copy code
dart run bin/wofa.dart example.wofa
This command will tokenize and parse the Wofa script, then execute it.

Code Structure
bin/wofa.dart: Entry point of the Wofa interpreter.
lib/tokenizer.dart: Contains the tokenizer logic for the Wofa language.
lib/parser.dart: Contains the parser logic for the Wofa language.
test/: Contains unit tests for the tokenizer and parser.
Running Tests
To run the tests and ensure everything is functioning correctly:

sh
Copy code
dart test
